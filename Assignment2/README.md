## Problem Statement

Given an NxN chessboard and a Knight at position (x,y). The Knight has to
take exactly K steps, where at each step it chooses any of the 8 directions
uniformly at random. What is the probability that the Knight remains in
the chessboard after taking K steps, with the condition that it canâ€™t enter
the board again once it leaves it? Solve using Dynamic programming.
